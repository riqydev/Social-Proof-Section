## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

### Links

- Live Site URL: [here](https://riqydev.github.io/Social-Proof-Section/)

## My process


### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS (SASS)
- CSS Grid & Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I'm very new to html & css so this was a great learning experience for me. It was my first time working with a mobile-first workflow and also my first time using grid. Using grid-area-templates like:

```css
.container {
  display:grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-areas: 
  "content1 content2"
  "content3 content3";
}
```
was really useful for me. It makes layout creation a lot easier and is good for visual learners like myself. It also allows you to completely redesign your layout with media queries super easily.


### Continued development

Since it was my first time using grid, I think I have some ways to go until I'm fully comfortable with positioning etc. I need to work on positioning grid-items and get that drilled into my head. My solution is probably very messy due to it being my first time, but I'm looking forward to improving!
